I’m a DevOps/Cloud-Native/SRE engineer focused on IaC and platform reliability.  
- Turn ideas into shipped products and share what I learn.  
- Transform complex, fragile workflows into reliable, automated systems so teams can ship with confidence without manual toil.
- Specialize in automation and platform building.  .

## How I Work

- **Everything versioned**: prefer declarative configuration; all changes live in Git.  
- **Fast and recoverable pipelines**: build CI/CD that is quick, observable, and rollback-friendly.  
- **Security built-in**: make scanning, least privilege, and secrets hygiene the default.

## What’s Next

I’m continuously improving GitOps workflows, strengthening software supply-chain security, and exploring better self-service platforms for developers.  
If you’re interested in SRE, IaC, and platform engineering, I’d love to connect.  
I’m also actively learning and building on AWS, including cloud architecture.
