This is where I document my hands‑on work and thinking in Cloud‑Native / DevOps / SRE. The writing is designed so we can “use it right away,” walking from install and configuration to runnable examples and risk controls, step by step.

## Topics I Focus On

- Kubernetes & GitOps: cluster bootstrapping, networking and Dashboard, declarative deployments and release governance with Argo CD.
- CI/CD & supply chain security: Jenkins pipelines, image build and push, Trivy image/file scanning with enforced thresholds.
- Artifact/Registry: deploying Harbor on K8s/Ubuntu, HTTPS, and private registry operations.
- Linux & virtualization: Ubuntu administration, Proxmox hands‑on (including serial console and xterm.js integration).
- Development & service‑ization: building services with Go, React, and MongoDB; containerization and API documentation (Swagger).
- Cloud & architecture: ongoing practice with AWS architecture design, IAM governance, containers, and CI/CD integration.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Implementation Notes (Note): concise how‑tos and troubleshooting logs to help you hit the goal quickly.
- Project Cases (Portfolio): from requirements and design to a runnable prototype—end‑to‑end delivery stories.
- Processes/Templates: common operations distilled into reusable commands, YAML/Helm, and pipeline snippets.
- Risks & Postmortems: root causes, observability angles, recovery playbooks, and hardening checklists.
- Tag navigation: tags at the end of posts and on list pages (e.g., #K8s #Docker #Jenkins …); use the on‑page filters to focus on topics.

## Featured Work

- AutoSEL: automatically generate and apply container policies to reduce manual effort and risk.
- TickBoard: a task board, fully containerized with a Swagger‑documented API.
- TickBoard runs on a DevOps workflow powered by GitOps, and Terraform-provisioned AWS EKS.

## Writing Style & Principles

- Everything in Git: prefer declarative configuration; every change is traceable and rollback‑friendly.
- Reproducible & observable: provide minimum viable steps and verification points for fast fault isolation.
- Secure by default: scanning, least privilege, and secret management are defaults—not add‑ons.
- Visuals when helpful: key steps come with comments and diagrams to aid understanding and reuse.
