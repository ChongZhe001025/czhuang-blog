## ðŸ”‘ Security recommendations
1. **Avoid password authentication**  
   Use **SSH key authentication** and disable password login to reduce brute-force risks.
   ```text
   PasswordAuthentication no
   ```

2. **Restrict source IPs**  
   Limit allowed SSH source IPs using a firewall (UFW / iptables / Security Group).

3. **Change the SSH port**  
   Change the default port 22 to a custom port to reduce scanning attempts.

4. **Use Fail2Ban**  
   Install and enable Fail2Ban to protect against SSH brute-force attacks.

You can log in as root with:
```bash
ssh root@<SERVER_IP>
```
